# META-CXR: Multimodal Expert Tokens-Based Vision-Language Model for Abnormality-guided Chest X-Ray Reporting

META-CXR is an advanced vision-language framework that bridges the gap between automated chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation and clinical application. Designed to provide accurate abnormality classification and generate coherent radiology reports, META-CXR incorporates multimodal learning, expert token representations, and cutting-edge vision encoders and large languge models(LLM) to enhance diagnostic precision and explainability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Multi-Class Abnormality Classification**:
   - META-CXR introduces a classification mechanism that identifies abnormalities as **positive**, **negative**, or **uncertain**, mimicking real-world clinical scenarios.
   - Tailored thresholds for each class improve inference reliability and ensure precise abnormality detection.

2. **Radiology Report Generation**:
   - Utilizes a large language model (LLM) integrated with abnormality findings to generate clinically relevant radiology reports.
   - Reports align with clinical standards, maintaining semantic coherence and diagnostic accuracy.

3. **Expert Token Representations**:
   - Learnable query tokens extract abnormality-specific high-level features, significantly improving classification and report generation tasks.

4. **Multi-Encoder Vision Fusion**:
   - Combines the strengths of ResNet50, Vision Transformer (ViT), and Swin Transformer to capture local and global features.
   - Demonstrates superior performance by leveraging diverse architectural capabilities for feature extraction.

5. **Explainable AI (XAI)**:
   - Includes attention map visualizations that highlight critical regions in the X-rays, offering transparent and interpretable outputs.
   - Enables clinicians to understand the rationale behind model predictions.

6. **Web Interface**:
   - A user-friendly interface allows users to upload chest X-rays for instant classification, report generation, and attention map visualization.
   - Designed for real-time use, making META-CXR accessible to clinicians and researchers alike.
